# Diabetes Prediction Model
  
## Overview

This project focuses on developing a diabetes prediction model using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, aiming to create an effective classifier for predicting diabetes based on medical and demographic data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes medical and demographic data for individuals, with features relevant to diabetes prediction, such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and other clinical measurements. The data preprocessing steps ensure proper handling of missing values, data scaling, and encoding where necessary.

## Project Structure

  ### Data Preprocessing: 
  Includes loading the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features to prepare the data for model training.
  ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  Examines key patterns and distributions within the dataset to understand feature relationships and identify influential predictors.
  ### Model Selection and Training: 
  Implements multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to determine the best-performing model based on various metrics.
  ### Evaluation: 
  Assesses model performance using accuracy score metrics, with an emphasis on interpretability and real-world relevance.

## Requirements

The project relies on the following libraries:

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    numpy: For numerical operations.
    scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
    matplotlib and seaborn: For visualizing data distributions and correlations.
